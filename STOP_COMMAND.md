# STOP Command Implementation

The TCP radar server now supports a `STOP` command that allows clients to pause radar data streaming without disconnecting.

## Commands Supported

1. **SEND_DATA** - Start receiving radar sweep data
2. **STOP** - Stop receiving radar sweep data (but keep connection alive)

## How it Works

1. Client connects to the server (port 8080 or 8081)
2. Client sends `SEND_DATA` command to start receiving radar sweeps
3. Server begins streaming radar data to the client
4. Client can send `STOP` command to pause data streaming
5. Client can send `SEND_DATA` again to resume data streaming
6. This can be repeated as many times as needed

## Key Features

- **Non-destructive**: STOP command does not close the connection
- **Resumable**: Client can resume streaming by sending SEND_DATA again
- **Immediate**: STOP takes effect immediately - no more data will be sent
- **Per-client**: Each client can independently start/stop their data stream

## Server Behavior

- When a client sends `STOP`, the server marks that client as "not ready"
- The radar broadcaster will skip sending data to clients marked as "not ready"
- When a client sends `SEND_DATA` after STOP, they are marked as "ready" again
- The server continues to generate radar sweeps for all ready clients

## Testing

Use the provided test client to verify the STOP functionality:

```bash
# Start the server (in one terminal)
cargo run --bin server

# Run the test client (in another terminal)
cargo run --bin stop_test_client
```

The test client will:

1. Connect and start receiving data
2. Read data for 5 seconds
3. Send STOP command
4. Verify no more data is received for 3 seconds
5. Send SEND_DATA to resume
6. Verify data streaming resumes

## Example Client Code

```rust
// Start receiving data
stream.write_all(b"SEND_DATA").await?;

// ... receive radar sweeps ...

// Stop receiving data
stream.write_all(b"STOP").await?;

// ... no more data will be received ...

// Resume receiving data
stream.write_all(b"SEND_DATA").await?;

// ... radar sweeps will resume ...
```

## Implementation Details

The server uses two separate tasks per client:

1. **Initial connection handler** - Waits for the first SEND_DATA command
2. **Ongoing command handler** - Continues to listen for SEND_DATA/STOP commands

This design allows clients to control their data stream dynamically while maintaining the connection.

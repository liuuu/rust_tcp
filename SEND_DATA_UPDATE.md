# Updated Server Behavior - SEND_DATA Command

## Overview

The radar TCP server has been updated to implement a command-based data streaming approach. Instead of immediately sending data when clients connect, the server now waits for clients to explicitly request data streaming by sending a "SEND_DATA" command.

## New Behavior

### Server Side

1. **Accept Connections**: Server accepts client connections on configured ports (8080, 8081)
2. **Wait for Command**: After connection, server waits for the client to send "SEND_DATA" command
3. **Start Streaming**: Only after receiving "SEND_DATA", the server begins streaming radar data to that client
4. **Synchronized Operation**: Server waits for both clients to be ready before starting the radar sweep generation

### Client Side

1. **Connect**: Client connects to server on specified port
2. **Send Command**: Client sends "SEND_DATA" string to server
3. **Receive Data**: Server begins streaming radar sweep data to the client

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Server Structure Updates

- Added `ReadyClients` type to track which clients are ready for data
- Updated `RadarTcpServer` struct to include `ready_clients` field
- Modified function signatures to pass ready client tracking

### 2. Connection Handling

- `start_server_on_port()` now spawns `handle_client_connection()` for each client
- `handle_client_connection()` reads commands from client and processes "SEND_DATA"
- Clients are marked as ready only after sending the command

### 3. Data Broadcasting

- `radar_data_broadcaster()` now checks both connection and ready status
- Only sends data to clients that are both connected AND ready
- Maintains synchronization between ready clients

### 4. Status Messages

- Updated console output to reflect command-based approach
- Clear indication when clients are ready vs just connected

## Testing

### Demo Client

A new demo client (`send_data_client.rs`) has been created to test the functionality:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
cargo run --bin server

# Terminal 2: Run demo client
cargo run --bin send_data_client
```

### Manual Testing

1. Start the server
2. Connect clients to ports 8080 and 8081
3. Observe that server waits for "SEND_DATA" command
4. Send "SEND_DATA" from each client
5. Verify that data streaming begins only after both clients are ready

## Usage Example

```bash
# Start server
cargo run --bin server

# In another terminal, test with demo client
cargo run --bin send_data_client
# Follow prompts to select port and send command
```

The server will now show:

- "Client X connected. Waiting for 'SEND_DATA' command..."
- "Client X requested data streaming"
- "Client X is now ready for data streaming"
- "ðŸ”„ Both clients ready! Resetting sequence counter for synchronization."

## Benefits

1. **Controlled Start**: Clients can connect and prepare before requesting data
2. **Explicit Protocol**: Clear command-based protocol for data streaming
3. **Synchronization**: Ensures both clients are ready before starting radar sweeps
4. **Flexibility**: Clients can connect at different times and request data when ready

## Backward Compatibility

This change modifies the communication protocol. Existing clients that don't send the "SEND_DATA" command will connect but won't receive any radar data until they send the command.
